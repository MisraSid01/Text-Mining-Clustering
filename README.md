# Text-Mining-Clustering
Text Mining a document and cluster various topics within the document.

The program takes a .csv document and performs cluster analysis on the most frequent words.
This program uses a two - page article on Game Theory for analysis. (https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GameTheory.html)
I used both Hierarchial and K-means clustering to observe and analyze the difference between their outputs.

Any edits, inputs and criticisms welcome!
